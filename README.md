### ❓ Common Questions

> **Where are the servers located?**

``` The German Lavalink server is located at Falkenstein, Germany and the United States Lavalink server is located at Ashburn, USA. If there is a need for a server somewhere else and lots of people are interested, I will try to create one :)```

> **Can your servers get ratelimited?**

``` My lavalink servers have lots of IPs available to prevent rate limits. All this time of running lavalink servers with this setup, I never had any issues regarding ratelimits.```

> **What are the specs of your servers**

```
Based on the budget I have available, I am trying to get the best possible hardware for my servers.

> German Server
CPU: 2 Cores
RAM: 2GB
NET: 1G

> USA Server
CPU: 2 Cores
RAM: 512MB
NET: 1G

Depending on the load and the amount of people using the servers, I will try upgrading the server specs to make sure 
everybody can use the servers without issues. Sadly, pricing on the USA server is higher, thus making it 
harder to provide better hardware. With the support of the community, this can be easily made possible :)
```

> **Should I ask for permission to use your servers?**

```
Of course not! These servers are ment to be used by everyone, so you can connect and disconnect your bot whenever
you like! I would be more than happy to see you using my servers!
